Process:
---------Listing Process and Threads----------
pidin /* get the process and how many threads were executing and its status */
pidin -p <PID> /*List threads within a specific process*/
------- Terminate process ----------------
kill <PID> /* Process can be killed forcefully and it sends the SIGTERM signal, which requests graceful termination*/
kill -9 <PID> /*o forcefully terminate the process, you can send the SIGKILL signal*/
slay <process_name> /*The slay utility allows you to terminate a process by its name rather than its PID, which can be more convenient*/
